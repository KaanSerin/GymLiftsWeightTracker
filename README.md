# GymLiftsWeightTracker
<h3>An android app to track weights for common bodybuilding exercises lifts</h3>
<p>This is a very simple app I made using Unity, to keep track of my weight goals for each exercise or lift.
You can add all of your favourite exercises in a scrollable list format, enter your current max weight, and adjust your max using the + and - buttons.</p>
