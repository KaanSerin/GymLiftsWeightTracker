# GymLiftsWeightTracker
<h3>An android app to track weights for common bodybuilding exercises lifts</h3>
<p>This is a very simple app I made using Unity, to keep track of my weight goals for each exercise or lift.
I added the all of the exercises I do in a scrollable list format and added a simple textBox with which I can manually
write my current max weight for that exercise</p>
